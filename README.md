# Edge-Cloud Collaborative Satellite Image Analysis for Efficient Man-Made Structure Recognitionï¼ˆIEEE under review)

This project utilizes the UCMerced Land Use Dataset for training and evaluating various models to classify images into artificial and natural categories in an attempt to strike a balance between accuracy and latency. The code supports the research presented in the paper "Edge-Cloud Collaborative Satellite Image Analysis for Efficient Man-Made Structure Recognition".

## Dataset

The dataset can be downloaded from the following link:
[UCMerced Land Use Dataset](http://weegee.vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html)

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `code`: Contains the Python scripts for data processing, model definition, training, and evaluation.
- `examples`: Contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the experiments and results.

## Code Structure

### Data Preparation

The data preparation script (`data_preparation.py`) handles the following tasks:
- Loading the UCMerced Land Use Dataset.
- Applying necessary transformations.
- Updating labels to classify images as artificial or natural.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Creating data loaders for batch processing.

### Model Definitions

The model definitions script (`models.py`) includes:
- `SimpleCNN`: A simple convolutional neural network for baseline comparison.
- `ModifiedMobileNetV2`: A modified MobileNetV2 model for improved performance.
- `ModifiedShuffleNet`: A modified ShuffleNet model for efficiency.
- `MobileShuffleNet`: A custom hybrid model combining MobileNetV2 and ShuffleNet features.

### Training and Evaluation

The training and evaluation script (`train_and_evaluate.py`) performs:
- Training of the model using the training dataset.
- Evaluation of the model using the testing dataset.
- Calculation of accuracy, recall, and F1 score.

### Visualization

The visualization script (`visualization.py`) provides functions to:
- Display sample images from the dataset.
- Show incorrect predictions made by the model.
- Save images to local directories for further inspection.

## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
    cd yourrepository
    ```

2. **Download the dataset**:
    Download the UCMerced Land Use Dataset from [here](http://weegee.vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html) and extract it to the appropriate directory.

3. **Install dependencies**:
    Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed:
    ```sh
    pip install torch torchvision matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```

4. **Run the data preparation script**:
    ```sh
    python code/data_preparation.py
    ```

5. **Train and evaluate the model**:
    ```sh
    python code/train_and_evaluate.py
    ```

6. **Visualize the results**:
    ```sh
    python code/visualization.py
    ```
