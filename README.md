# Edge-Cloud Collaborative Satellite Image Analysis for Efficient Man-Made Structure Recognitionï¼ˆIEEE under review)

This project utilizes the UCMerced Land Use Dataset for training and evaluating various models to classify images into artificial and natural categories in an attempt to strike a balance between accuracy and latency. The code supports the research presented in the paper "Edge-Cloud Collaborative Satellite Image Analysis for Efficient Man-Made Structure Recognition".

## Dataset

The dataset can be downloaded from the following link:
[UCMerced Land Use Dataset](http://weegee.vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html)

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `code`: Contains the Python scripts for data processing, model definition, training, and evaluation.
- `examples`: Contains results for the experiments.

## Code Structure

### Data processing

The data processing script (`data_processing.py`) handles the following tasks:
- Loading the UCMerced Land Use Dataset.
- Applying necessary transformations.
- Updating labels to classify images as artificial or natural.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Creating data loaders for batch processing.

### Model Definitions

The model definitions script (`models.py`) includes:
- `SimpleCNN`: A simple convolutional neural network for baseline comparison.
- `ModifiedMobileNetV2`: A modified MobileNetV2 model for improved performance.
- `ModifiedShuffleNet`: A modified ShuffleNet model for efficiency.
- `MobileShuffleNet`: A custom hybrid model combining MobileNetV2 and ShuffleNet features.

### Training and Evaluation

The training and evaluation script (`train_and_evaluate.py`) performs:
- Training of the model using the training dataset.
- Evaluation of the model using the testing dataset.
- Calculation of accuracy, recall, and F1 score.

### Visualization

The visualization script (`visualization.py`) provides functions to:
- Display sample images from the dataset.
- Show incorrect predictions made by the model.
- Save images to local directories for further inspection.


### Data Transmission

The data transmission script (`transmit.py`) handles the following tasks:
- Classifying images and separating those predicted as "Artificial".
- Transferring images to a remote server using SFTP.
- Measuring and reporting the time taken for classification and data transfer.

## Examples

Examples of the experiment and results can be found in the `examples` folder.
